The project involves sorting data on two stacks using a limited set of operations and achieving this with minimal moves. It requires developing efficient algorithms to handle and manipulate data structures, exploring sorting techniques like quicksort or mergesort adapted to stack operations.


Technologies used: C, algorithmic design.
